title: It's time to pass the AWS Certified Developer Associate exam
visible: true
---

Recently, I passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam. Now, it's time to move on to the next step: the AWS Certified Developer – Associate exam.

Here's my plan for preparing for this exam:

1. **Take practice exams** – I'll focus on covering all the topics that come up in the questions, without worrying too much about the score at first.
2. **Review and study** – After each practice exam, I’ll go over all the content and notes I’ve taken, identifying areas where I need to improve.
3. **Retake practice exams** – Once I feel confident with the material, I'll take the practice exams again, this time aiming for an 80% score or higher, without relying on notes.

The mock exams I'll be using to prepare come from <a href="https://skillcertpro.com/aws-certified-developer-associate-exam-questions/" target="_blank">SKILLCERTPRO</a>.

See you studying!
