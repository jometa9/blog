title: "Kicking off my 30-day intermittent fasting challenge"
---
Lately, I've been feeling “fat and slow.” I think most of us go through phases where our bodies send us a wake-up call to take better care of ourselves. For me, it’s been a reminder to pay more attention to my health and fitness.

Sometimes, that wake-up call means it's time for more exercise, healthier eating, or simply cutting back on the junk food. For me, it’s all of the above.

A Quick Disclaimer: I'm not a nutritionist, just a nerdy software developer who’s passionate about health and wellness. Over the years, I’ve turned to intermittent fasting during certain seasons to shed a few pounds, feel more energized, and bring more structure to my eating habits.

But now, I’m ready to make this a permanent part of my lifestyle—not just a seasonal habit to hit specific goals.

So, here’s my challenge: 30 days of intermittent fasting, with 23 hours of fasting each day.

Current weight: 71.60 kilograms.

Let the game begin! I’ll check back in 30 days with the results. Stay tuned!
